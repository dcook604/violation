# npm resolution error report

While resolving: frontend@0.1.0
Found: react@19.1.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.1.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.8.5 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-beautiful-dnd@13.1.1
node_modules/react-beautiful-dnd
  react-beautiful-dnd@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
